Me:
I want my website to be split into 2 sections: "By Day" will have content about my career and professional skills, and the "By Night" section will have content about my hobbies. I want my hobbies to be split into sections, "Geeking Out," which will be music, movie and book reviews, and "Making," which will showcase my art. Can you help me organize this website plan?
