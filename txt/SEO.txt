- **Relevance:** How well does this keyword represent your website's content and target audience?

By considering these factors, you can refine your list and choose keywords that are relevant, have decent search volume, and aren't overly competitive.

Remember, keyword research is an ongoing process. As your website evolves, you may need to revisit and refine your keyword strategy to ensure it remains effective.
